# Pystage

### What is this Project
This is a sample project to demonstrate game programming basics using [Pystage](https://github.com/pystage/pystage), a Python API for [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

### Set Up

This guide is meant to walk you through setting up this project, on the assumption that you start with nothing.
If one of these steps does not apply to you, simply skip it.

#### Installing Python

Navigate to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python.
This page will automatically recommend the most recent version of Python for your operating system.
Once installation is complete, test that you have properly installed Python by opening one of the following:
- A `Command Prompt` window for Windows users
- A `Terminal` window for Mac users

And running the command `python -V`.
It should print out your version of Python.

#### Installing Pycharm

In order to be able to work on this code, you need an IDE, and I am recommending [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for that.
On the Pycharm website, click on the `Download` button in the middle of the screen.
On the new page it takes you to, click on the `Download` button for the free Community version, on the right-hand side of the screen.

Once it is installed, open up Pycharm.

#### Cloning in this GitHub Repository

Now that you have an IDE installed, you have to clone in the code for this project to be able to modify and run it.
